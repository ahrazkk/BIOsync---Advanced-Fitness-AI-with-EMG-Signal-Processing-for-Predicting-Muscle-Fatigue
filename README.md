# BIOsync - Advanced Fitness AI with EMG Signal Processing for Predicting Muscle Fatigue

**Project Period:** November 2024 - November 2024

**Affiliation:** Ryerson University

BIOsync is an innovative project integrating Electromyography (EMG) signal processing and machine learning to predict muscle fatigue and optimize workouts in real time. It processes raw EMG data to extract meaningful features, trains predictive models to estimate the likelihood of muscle failure, and visualizes actionable insights for better decision-making.

## Key Functionalities

*   **Preprocessing:** Raw EMG signals are processed using noise filtering and signal smoothing to ensure data quality.
*   **Feature Extraction:**  Identifies patterns in muscle activity, enabling accurate fatigue probability predictions.
*   **Real-time Predictions:** Provides users with actionable feedback and insights during workouts.
*   **Custom Visualizations:** Helps users understand performance metrics and trends.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** Core development language.
*   **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network:** AI-based fatigue prediction.
*   **OpenAI GPT Integration:** Human-to-AI interface.
*   **Digital Signal Processing (DSP):** Cleaning raw EMG data.

## Project Description

BIOsync lays the foundation for AI-enabled fitness tracking solutions, supporting safe and effective workout routines by delivering personalized, data-driven feedback.  This project aims to enhance workout efficiency and injury prevention by providing real-time insights into muscle fatigue.  By analyzing EMG signals, BIOsync can help users understand their muscle activity and make informed decisions about their training.
