# BIOsync---Advanced-Fitness-AI-with-EMG-Signal-Processing-for-Predicting-Muscle-Fatigue
BIOsync is an innovative project integrating Electromyography (EMG) signal processing and machine learning to predict muscle fatigue and optimize workouts in real time. It processes raw EMG data to extract meaningful features, trains predictive models to estimate the likelihood of muscle failure, and visualizes actionable insights.
